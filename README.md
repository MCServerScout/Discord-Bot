# Dollar Tree Copenheimer (Discord Bot)

This is a Discord bot that I made for my friends and I to use in our Discord server. It is a work in progress, and I
will be adding more features as time goes on.

- [ ] Sort through the servers
  - [ ] players online

## Commands

### Find

`/find <filter> <value>`

This command will find a server based on the filter and value you give it.
You can use multiple filters at once, and the bot will find a server that matches all of them.

### Help

`/help`

This command will show you a list of all the commands and how to use them.
