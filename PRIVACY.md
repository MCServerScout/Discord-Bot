# Privacy Agreement

Thank you for using our bot! We take your privacy very seriously, and we want to make sure that you understand how we
handle your data.

## Information We Collect

Our bot is designed to scan Minecraft servers and collect information about them,
including data such as host information, version, players in the server at the time of scanning and description.
This information is stored securely on our servers
and is used to provide you with the best possible experience using our bot.
If any error occurs when requesting a server,
the bot may temporarily log the arguments passed for troubleshooting purposes,
these logs are cleared daily or at the request of any user.

We want to make it clear that we do not collect any information about individual users who interact with our bot.
This means that we do not store any personal information about the Discord user who invokes a command.

**NB**: Any arguments passed in a command are logged for troubleshooting purposes.

## Keeping Your Data Safe

We take the security of your data very seriously.
We have implemented a range of measures to ensure that your information is kept safe,
primarily through collecting as little data as possible.
We will never share your data with any third-party without your explicit consent.

## Your Rights

You have the right to request access to the information we hold about you at any time.
You also have the right to ask us to delete your data or to restrict its use.
If your server is found in the database, and you want to have it removed,
please contact `pilot1782` on discord, or via email `34791564a@gmail.com` to request a deletion.
If you have any questions or concerns about how we handle your data, please don't hesitate to contact us.

## Changes to Our Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time
to reflect changes in our practices or to comply with legal requirements.
We will notify you of any significant changes to our policy
and will always post the most up-to-date version on our website.

By using our bot, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Agreement.
If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use our bot.
